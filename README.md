## How to Play
1. For each move you click and flip two cards. If the cards match, they will remain open, otherwise they will be flipped back. Once you match all cards, you win!
2. Once you click the first card, the timer begins. The total time does not count as star rating.
3. You will get 3 stars if you finish the game in 20 moves; 2 stars in 40 moves; 1 star for more than 40 moves. If you click a card and flip it back, it still counts as one move.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
